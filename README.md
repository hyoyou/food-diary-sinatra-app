#Food Diary Sinatra Application

This is a Sinatra Application that I created for my Sinatra Final Project at Learn//Flatiron School.
Users can create logs for a specific date to add meals and calories for that day.
It helps keep track of user's meals for the day and displays the total calories eaten for that day.

##Usage

After cloning the repo, run `bundle install` to install dependencies. To migrate your local database, run `rake db:migrate`. To start the application on your machine, run `shotgun`. In a browser, go to http://localhost:9393/ to begin (Note: you may be using a different port. Please update accordingly).
